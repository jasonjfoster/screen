Description: Simple and efficient access to Yahoo Finance's 'screener' API <https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/> for querying and retrieval of financial data. The core functionality abstracts the complexities of interacting with Yahoo Finance APIs, such as session management, crumb and cookie handling, query construction, pagination, and JSON payload generation. This abstraction allows users to focus on filtering and retrieving data rather than managing API details. Use cases include screening across a range of security types including equities, mutual funds, ETFs, indices, and futures. The package supports advanced query capabilities, including logical operators, nested filters, and customizable payloads. It automatically handles pagination to ensure efficient retrieval of large datasets by fetching results in batches of up to 250 entries per request. Filters can be dynamically defined to accommodate a wide range of screening needs. The implementation leverages standard HTTP libraries to handle API interactions efficiently and provides support for both R and Python to ensure accessibility for a broad audience.
